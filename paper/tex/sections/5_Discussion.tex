% Discussion of your findings and their implications
\textbf{Here we can, for example, compare how our methods can perform better than other methods that already exist.}
Example:

There have been many instances of robotic entities docking on their own without human intervention, even without the use of vision-based systems. For example, infrared sensors have been used for a while in order to detect and align with the dock. Other sensors include LiDAR and ultrasonic sensors. Our method of using only vision would work much better with these systems, however, when paired in conjunction to a pathfinding algorithm, likely based on machine learning. We would use the same cameras for docking to automate path making and traveling around an area. This allows for less hardware and complications regarding the overall robot functionality. Plus, relying on vision-based systems is much more flexible and adaptable to future and different environments.

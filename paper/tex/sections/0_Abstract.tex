\textit{Autonomous robot docking enables robots to recharge or continue their tasks without human intervention. Traditional docking solutions rely on multiple sensors and reinforcement learning to achieve precise alignment. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach using monocular vision and basic deep learning techniques to predict docking actions from a single input frame. Our method eliminates the need for additional sensors, policy optimization, or reward functions. We conduct experiments in the Godot game engine to simulate real-world deployment. Our results demonstrate that a supervised learning approach can effectively guide docking maneuvers while maintaining simplicity and practicality.}

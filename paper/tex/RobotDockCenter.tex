% Abstract of your paper
Robot docking is a critical task in autonomous systems. 
It allows a robotic entity to continue its designated workflow without the need for human intervention. 
Autonomous docking solutions have typically been centered on using and combining various sensors including LIDAR scanners and ultrasonic sensors, and even combining such sensors with cameras \citep{app131910675}. 
In the world of robotics, reinforcement learning has recently played a major role in further developing autonomy. 
In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to robot docking using monocular vision without the need of additional sensors or reinforcement learning. 
We use basic deep learning techniques to predict the next action based on a single input frame containing the target docking station.
Our approach is supervised and does not require any form of reward function or policy optimization.

\section{Introduction}
Robot docking is a fundamental task in autonomous systems, enabling robots to recharge and continue their designated workflows without human intervention. Traditional autonomous docking solutions often rely on a combination of various sensors, such as LIDAR scanners, ultrasonic sensors, and cameras \citep{app131910675}. While these multi-sensor approaches can be effective, they introduce additional hardware complexity and cost.

In recent years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a popular method for enhancing robotic autonomy. However, reinforcement learning techniques typically require extensive training with reward functions and policy optimization, which can be computationally intensive and time-consuming.

In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to robot docking that leverages monocular vision and supervised learning. Our method eliminates the need for additional sensors and reinforcement learning, simplifying the hardware requirements and reducing computational overhead. By using deep learning techniques, we predict the necessary target coordinates for the robot to dock accurately based on a single input frame containing one of two targets: The first target that is required for the robot to know it is centered with the dock, and the second target, the docking station itself.

We utilize the Godot game engine to create a simulated environment for data collection, capturing images of the docking station from various angles and distances. These images are then used to train a deep learning model implemented in PyTorch. The trained model is capable of making real-time predictions, which can be integrated with a Flask server to facilitate seamless communication with the robot's control system to test the performance in a virtual docking environment.

Our approach demonstrates that monocular vision, combined with deep learning, can be a viable solution for robot docking when dealing with limited compute power. This method not only simplifies the hardware setup but also provides accurate and efficient docking without the need for complex reinforcement learning algorithms. The rest of this paper is focused on the virtual world, but a very important idea here is that these methods can all be used to train a real-world robot to dock in the real world, as described later on.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work in the field of robot docking. Section 3 details our methodology, including data collection, model training, and inference. Section 4 presents our experimental results and evaluation metrics. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and outlines future research directions.

\section{Related Work}
The work of \citet{app131910675} provides a comprehensive review of existing docking methods.

\section{Methodology}
% Description of your proposed methodology or approach
In this section, we describe our approach to robot docking using monocular vision and deep learning techniques. Our methodology involves data collection, model training, and inference, as detailed below.

\subsection{Data Collection}
We collect training data using a simulated environment created in Godot, a popular game engine. The environment consists of a robot and a docking station, with the robot's camera capturing images of the docking station from various angles. We then extract the coordinates of the targets using OpenCV, something that can only be done in the virtual world, as the real world does indeed have red and green in its colors, not just for the targets (as is used in the virtual world).
\textbf{(Here, we will include a figure showing the simulated environment and how everything works)}

\subsection{Model Training}
% We train a deep learning model using PyTorch, as implemented in [src/machine_learning/model1/train.py](src/machine_learning/model1/train.py). The model architecture is defined in the `Predictor` class, and the training process involves the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Load and preprocess the images using the `transforms` module from torchvision.
    \item Define the custom dataset class `TargetsDataset` to handle the input data.
    \item Instantiate the model, loss function (L1 Loss), and optimizer (Adam).
    \item Train the model over multiple epochs, adjusting the weights based on the loss calculated from the predicted and actual target values.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Inference}
For inference, we use the trained model to predict the next action based on a single input frame. The `predict` function takes an image as input, preprocesses it, and outputs the predicted target coordinates.

\subsection{Server Integration}
To facilitate real-time predictions, we can integrate the inference script with a Flask server, as shown in . The server receives images via POST requests, runs the inference, and returns the next action the virtual robot should take. This setup allows for seamless integration with other systems and real-time decision-making.

\subsection{Evaluation}
We evaluate the performance of our model using various metrics, including accuracy and loss values. The evaluation scripts are included in [tests/tests.py](tests/tests.py), which contain unit tests to ensure the correctness and robustness of our data processing and model training pipelines.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
Our experimental setup involves running the training and inference scripts on a machine with a GPU to accelerate the deep learning computations. The models are saved in the [models](models) directory, and the results are analyzed and visualized using matplotlib.

\subsection{Conclusion}
Our methodology demonstrates a novel approach to robot docking using monocular vision and deep learning. By leveraging a simulated environment for data collection and a robust training pipeline, we achieve accurate and efficient docking without the need for additional sensors or reinforcement learning.

% Summary of your work and future directions
In this paper, we presented a novel approach to robot docking using monocular vision and deep learning techniques. Our methodology leverages a simulated environment created in Godot for data collection, followed by a robust training pipeline using PyTorch. The trained model predicts the necessary rotation and distance adjustments for the robot to dock accurately.

We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, showing that our model can achieve high accuracy in predicting docking maneuvers. The integration of the inference script with a Flask server enables real-time predictions, facilitating seamless communication with the robot's control system.

Our results indicate that monocular vision, combined with deep learning, can be a viable solution for robot docking, eliminating the need for additional sensors or complex reinforcement learning algorithms. This approach not only simplifies the hardware requirements but also reduces the computational overhead, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Future work will focus on improving the model's robustness and generalizability by incorporating more diverse training data and exploring advanced neural network architectures. Additionally, we plan to integrate the system with physical robots to validate its performance in real-world scenarios.

Overall, our work contributes to the field of autonomous robotics by providing an efficient and scalable solution for robot docking, paving the way for more advanced and autonomous robotic systems.
